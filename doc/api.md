## Application Program Interface (API) ##

### 1.Function app ###
```clj
(app <mode> <application-file>)
(app <mode> <application-file> <facts-file>)
```
Run the application.
- application-file (string) - a path to a file containing a list of templates, rules, functions and facts.
- facts-file (string) - a path to a file containing a list of facts. If used, this list of facts replaces the list of facts from the <application-file>.
- mode (string):
- "run"  - run the application synchronously, that is assert first fact and fire rules then assert second fact and fire rules and so on.
- "trace" - same with a tracing of creation of the rete network and tracing of firing rules and assertion and retraction of facts.
- "trace-long" - same verbose.
- "step"  - same as "trace" with a stop after firing one rule. Further execution can be continued by calling functions (fire N) or (fire) where N - a number of steps (firings of one rule). If N is ommited then fire till the very end.

In the modes with the tracing in a root directory are created three files:

- alpha-net-plan.txt	 - describes alpha part of the rete network.
- beta-net-plan.txt	 - describes beta part of the rete network.
- alpha-beta-links.txt - describes the links between alpha part and beta part of the rete network.

### 2.Function fact-list ###
```clj
(fact-list)
(fact-list '<type>)
```
Returns a list of facts (of type if supplied) in a working memory.

### 3.Function facts ###
```clj
(facts)
(facts '<type>)
```
Prints a list of facts (of type if supplied) in a working memory.

### 4.Function ppr ###
```clj
(ppr <type>)
```
Pretty prints facts of a specific type or all facts (<type> = :all) in a working memory.

### 5. Function run-with ###
```clj
(run-with <mode> <templates> <rules> <facts>)
```
Create the rete network and run using given mode.
- templates - a list of templates.
- rules - a list of rules.
- facts - a list of facts.

### 6. Functions trace/untrace ###
```clj
(trace)
(untrace)
```
Switches on/off tracing.

### 7. Functions step ###
```clj
(step)
(step N)
```
Fires rules 1 time (N times if supplied).

### 8. Functions run-with-modes ###
```clj
(run-with-mode <mode> <truff>)
(run-with-mode <mode> <trufs> <facts>)
```
Create the rete network and run run using given mode. Arguments are:
<mode> - "run" or "trace" or "step",
<truff> - a list of a form: ((templates ..) (rules ..) (functions ..) (facts ...)),
<trufs> - a list of a form: ((templates ..) (rules ..) (functions ..)),
<facts> - a list of facts.

### 9. Function create-rete ###
```clj
(create-rete <templates> <rules>)
```
Create the rete network and clear the working memory.
Arguments are the same as for run-with function.

### 10. Function assert-frame ###
```clj
(assert-frame <fact>)
```
Assert a fact into the working memory.

### 11. Function retract-fact ###
```clj
(retract-fact <fact-id>)
```
Retract a fact from the working memory.
- fact-id (integer) - index of the fact in the working memory.

### 12. Function modify-fact ###
```clj
(modify-fact <fact-id> <slot-value-map>)
```
Modify a fact in the working memory.
- fact-id (integer) - index of the fact in the working memory.
- slot-value-map - map of slots and their values.
During modification the old fact is deleted and a new fact created with the changed values ​​of slots according to map.

### 13. Function fire ###
```clj
(fire <number>)
(fire)
```
Fire a number of active rules. If the number is ommited fire till the very end.

### 14. Function try-fire ###
```clj
(try-fire <number> <exception-function>)
(try-fire <exception-function>)
```
Try fire a number of active rules. If the number is ommited try fire till the very end.
Catch an exception if arraised and handle with a provided exception function.
The exception function has a form: (<exception-function> <production> <context> <exception>)

### 15. Function reset ###
```clj
(reset)
```
Clear and initialize the working memory.

### 16. Function strategy-depth ###
```clj
(strategy-depth)
```
Set conflict resolution strategy to depth.

### 17. Function strategy-breadth ###
```clj
(strategy-breadth)
```
Set conflict resolution strategy to breadth.

### 18. Function run-loaded-facts ###
```clj
(run-loaded-facts <path>)
```
Load facts from path, assert all of them into working memory and run,
- path - string representing a path to a file.

### 19. Function only-load-facts ###
```clj
(only-load-facts <path>)
```
Load facts from path and assert all of them into working memory,
- path - string representing a path to a file.

### 20. Function save-facts ###
```clj
(save-facts <path>)
(save-facts <types> <path>)
```
Save all facts or facts of types to a file on a path in a format suitable to load,
- path - string representing a path to a file,
- types - collection of types of facts.

### 21. Function slot-value ###
```clj
(slot-value <slot> <fact>)
```
Returns value of a slot of a fact,
- slot - symbol representing a slot of a fact,
- fact - list representing a fact (as of item of result of the function fact-list).

### 22. Function facts-with-slot-value ###
```clj
(facts-with-slot-value <slot> <function> <value>)
(facts-with-slot-value <type> <slot> <function> <value>)
(facts-with-slot-value <type> <slot> <function> <value> <facts>)

```
Returns list of all facts or facts of type with slot values for which (function slot-value value) = true/not nil,
- slot - symbol representing a slot of a fact,
- function - symbol - predicate for selection of facts,
- type - symbol representing a type of a fact,
- value - any value,
- facts - list - preselected facts.

Examples:
```clj
(facts-with-slot-value 'PersonalData 'name = "Alice")
(facts-with-slot-value 'BloodPressure 'systolic > 140)
(facts-with-slot-value 'BloodPressure 'systolic > 140 (facts-with-slot-value 'BloodPressure 'diastolic > 90))
```
### 23. Function frame-by-id ###
```clj
(frame-by-id <fact-id>)
```
Returns a fact,
- fact-id - identifier (integer-number) of a fact as frame.


### 24. Function problem-solved ###
```clj
(problem-solved)
```
Function for clearing conflict set that can be used in the right hand side of the rule. Stops the expert system.


While embedding Rete for Frames into your code you can use other functions. See [source code] (https://github.com/rururu/rete4frames/blob/master/src/rete/core.clj).
